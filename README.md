Home Screen:

Use Salmon Red (#FF6B6B) for the "Emergency" button and key icons.
Set the background as Pale Grey (#EFEFEF) to keep it light and calming.
Text (e.g., "Are you in an emergency?") should be in Dark Grey (#2B2B2B) for contrast and readability.
Contacts and Emergency Types:

Contact cards can have Soft Peach (#FFD4D4) accents to differentiate them while maintaining a cohesive look.
Icons or emergency type options, such as "Accident" or "Chest Pain," should be in Salmon Red (#FF6B6B) to highlight importance.
